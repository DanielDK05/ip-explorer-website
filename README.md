# IP-explorer
This is a website that gives information about a given IP-adress.
It can find the broadcast address and network address.

It can also calculate subnet division, based on a given subnet amount. (Note that the amount of subnets will always be a power of 2, so if you want to calculate for 17 subnets, it will calculate 32 subnets.)
